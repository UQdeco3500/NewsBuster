# NewsBuster

Artificial Intelligence has shown popularity in media generation. However, there is increasing concern that AI-generated art impacts artists' creativity. For example, people use AI-generated art to win competitions which raises the concern of fairness and implies a substantial effect of limiting authentic artistsâ€™ contributions. Moreover, issues were discovered within the art community which entails the desire for social interactions during art viewing. Therefore, this application will aim to address both issues by providing an AI-free digital platform for art lovers to facilitate an authentic art community between artists. It also promotes in-person galleries so they can view authentic art in a physical space whilst fostering social interactions. This application consists of four main features, including AI detection, gallery discovery, authentic art showcasing, and live social interaction during exhibitions.
